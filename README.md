# 2D-PC-MS
Two-dimensional partial covariance mass spectrometry

This repository holds the software required for the implementation of two-dimensional partial covariance mass spectrometry (T. Driver et al., Phys. Rev. X 10, 041004 (2020)).
The code was developed using data collected in 'Turbo' mode using the Thermo Scientific LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer, and accepts as input the text file produced by the File Converter facility of Thermo Xcalibur software.
Although the technique of 2D-PC-MS is general to mass spectrometric measurements, in its current form this software will likely fail to produce the correct result for data collected with other instruments or using different scan parameters to those detailed in the Physical Review X publication. 

The repository also holds software for the implementation of the 2D-PC-MS protein database search engine (T. Driver et al., Anal. Chem. 93, 14946, (2021)).
